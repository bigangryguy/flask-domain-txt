<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
An Angular demonstration project for editing TXT records for fictitious domains and resources. 
This is nothing more than a made up use case for learning Angular and is not intended for any real world use. However, 
if you find anything useful in it for your own learning, that would make me happy.


### Built With

* [angular](https://angular.io/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. The instructions assume you are on a
Linux or Unix-like system. I can verify this will work on macOS as well.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system. Instructions for that depend on your OS; go
to the Node.js website for detailed instructions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/bigangryguy/angular-domain-txt.git
```
2. Install prerequisites (see above)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is a standard Angular CLI project. To run the server in development, execute this command in the source code root
folder:
```shell script
ng serve
```
